# Project-ARC
A Corporate Espionage Game where you unrealistically infiltrate overguarded buildings to achieve some vaguely defined end.

KNOWN ISSUES:
Exclamation point after being caught may appear in wrong place
Audio playback issues on Mac. Has to do with Pygame audio libraries, problem kind of solved with try/except.
Image blitting issues on Mac. Has to do with Pygame image libraries.
Player/Object clipping. Has to do with collision mechanics.
Improper image masking
Issues with file (ControlOptions.txt) reading on Mac. To solve this issue simply open the ControlOptions.txt file and the problem should be solved.
Unrealistic difficulty
How fun the game really is
